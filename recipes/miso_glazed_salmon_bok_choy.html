    <h1>MISO-GLAZED SALMON & BOK CHOY</h1>
       <img src="../images/fb98aa14-f433-42f5-968f-d89ab90090e2.webp" alt="MISO-GLAZED SALMON & BOK CHOY"><br>

    <p>Salty yet sweet, white miso is milder than red or yellow miso, typically made from a mixture of fermented soybeans and
    rice. Stirred with mirin and coconut sugar , it makes an excellent glaze for flaky roasted salmon fillets. A simple
    scallion oil simmered with ginger and garlic, plus a garnish of crunchy sesame seeds, help put this easy dish over the
    top.</p>
